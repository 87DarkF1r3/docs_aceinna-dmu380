OpenIMU300ZA *EZ Embed* module integrates highly-reliable MEMS inertial
sensors (acceleration, angular rate/gyro, and
magnetic field) in a miniature factory-calibrated package to provide
consistent performance through the extreme
operating environments.

OpenIMU300ZA has excellent acceleration and gyro performance that matches
systems ten times more expensive.
It is easy to syncronize and interface with external GPS, as well as other
sensors.
