    OpenIMU335 Module


The ACEINNA OpenIMU335RI is an easy-to-use high-performance 6-DOF (9 DOF is optional) open inertial platform packaged in a rugged 
sealed over-molded plastic housing. The OpenIMU335RI includes triple-redundant 3-Axis MEMS accelerometers and rate 
gyros which are fully calibrated over the operating temperature range. A 3-axis magnetic sensor is also available as an 
option. The processing power is provided by a 168MHz ARM M4 CPU with a Floating Point Unit. The OpenIMU335RI runs 
the OpenIMU open-source stack that includes an optimized 16-state Kalman Filter for Attitude and GPS-Aided PositionVelocity-Time (PVT) measurement. 
A free tool-chain based on VS Code supports PC, MAC, and Ubuntu.
