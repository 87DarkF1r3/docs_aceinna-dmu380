OpenIMU ships with a number of ready to use, `downloadable applications <https://developers.aceinna.com/apps>`__ 
to help you get started.

This section discusses algorithms that can make use of the OpenIMU's on-board magnetic sensor.  Currently, this 
is primarily for Magnetic Alignment also referred to as Compass Calibration, or Hard/Soft Iron Calibration.

In the future, this section may include other algorithms that make use of the magnetometer including event detection and
pedestrian dead reckoning.
