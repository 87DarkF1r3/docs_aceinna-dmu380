The difference between t\ :sub:`ground` and t\ :sub:`sky` gives us a
reading known as t\ :sub:`⊥`\ .

The difference between t\ :sub:`ground` and t\ :sub:`sky` gives us a
reading known as t\ :sub:`?`\ .

The power series, :math:`\frac{1}{0!}+\frac{2}{1!}x+\frac{3}{2!}x^2+\frac{4}{3!}x^3+...` states
that...



The well known quadratic formula:

.. math::


    x = -b \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}

 
   
The |biohazard| symbol must be used on containers used to dispose
of medical waste.

The :sub:|biohazard| symbol must be used on containers used to dispose
of medical waste.

The area of a circle is :math:`A_\text{c} = (\pi/4) d^2`.



If :math:`\sigma_{1}` equals :math:`\sigma_{2}` then etc, etc.


this is something :math:`\underline{x}=[  x_{1}, ...,  x_{n}]^{T}`
