*   The CAN DBC Example Application provides the framework for custom DBC-based applications for
    the OpenIMU300RI unit.
*   The example can be used as is or customized to suit the customer's system requirements.
*   DBC is a CAN Database specification developed by Vector (`Link to Vector Informatik GmbH <http://www.vector.com>`_)
*   DBC-based messages use the DBC format and keywords

.. note::

    *   The DBC Example Application is less mature than the J1939 Example Application, as the DBC Example Application is being ported
        from a proprietary DBC messaging application to an OpenIMU open source application.


The following pages describe the CAN DBC Example Application Details:

*   The DBC Format and Supported Keywords Specification
*   VSCode project for the DBC CAN Example Application

*   Example Application User Code Walkthrough

*   Task Synchronization Diagram for the Example Application
