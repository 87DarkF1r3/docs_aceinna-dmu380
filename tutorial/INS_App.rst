The Inertial Navigation System (INS) application causes the OpenIMU hardware to take
inertial-sensor data from accelerometers, rate-sensors, magnetometers, and GPS to form a fused
solution.

This application is under development.  Please check back soon.

.. note:: The OpenIMU300xI (RI & AI) units do not support GPS or other external sensor input, so those units can't support the INS application
