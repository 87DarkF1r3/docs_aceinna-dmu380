Algorithm Simulation System
===========================

**GNSS-IMU-SIM** is an IMU simulation project, which generates reference trajectories, IMU sensor output, GPS output, 
odometer output and magnetometer output. Users choose/set up the sensor model, define the waypoints and provide algorithms, 
and **gnss-imu-sim** can generated required data for the algorithms, run the algorithms, plot simulation results, 
save simulations results, and generate a brief summary.
