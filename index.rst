OpenIMU is a precisely calibrated open source Inertial Measurement Unit platform.  Users
are able to quickly develop and deploy custom navigation/localization algorithms and custom sensor integrations on top of the OpenIMU platform.  OpenIMU also
has pre-built drivers in Python as well as a developer website - Aceinna Navigation Studio (ANS).  These tools make logging and plotting data, including
custom data structures and packets very simple.
