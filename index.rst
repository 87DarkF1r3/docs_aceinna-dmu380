OpenIMU is a precisely calibrated open source Inertial Measurement Unit platform.  Users
are able to quickly develop and deploy custom navigation/localization algorithms and custom sensor integrations on top of the OpenIMU platform.  OpenIMU also 
has pre-built customizable hardware interface scripts in Python as well as a developer website - Aceinna Navigation Studio (ANS).  These tools support to make logging and plotting data, including
custom data structures and packets simple.
