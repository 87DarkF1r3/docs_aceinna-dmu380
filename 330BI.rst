The OpenIMU330BI module integrates highly-reliable MEMS inertial
sensors (acceleration, angular rate/gyro) in a miniature factory-calibrated package to provide
consistent performance through the extreme
operating environments.

It is easy to synchronize and interface with external GPS, as well as other
sensors.
The main feature of OpenIMU300BI is tripple redundancy for each inertial sensor.

* Integrated tripple redundant 3-Axis Angular Rate Sensors
* Integrated tripple redundant 3-Axis Accelerometer
* 80MHz STM32 M4 CPU with FPU
* SPI / UART Interfaces
* Sensors highest ODR is 200Hz
* Synchronization Input
* In-System Upgrade
* Ultra Small Size: 11x15x3 mm
* Wide Temp Range -40 to 85 |deg| C
* High Reliability > 50,000hr MTBF
* Low power
