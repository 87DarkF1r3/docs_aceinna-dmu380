The easy way to get stared quickly is to purchase an OpenIMU Developer's Kit from Aceinna https://www.aceinna.com or a local distributor.
The developer's kit includes an OpenIMU300EZ inertial measurement unit, JTAG Pod, Eval board, and precision test fixture.
The precision test fixture makes it easy to properly align and install the IMU in a target vehicle for integration testing.
