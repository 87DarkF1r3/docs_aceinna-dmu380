The OpenIMU300RA Eval Board is attached to a fixture for easy handling and isolation of the back side of the board from any contact.
The OpenIMU300EVB interfaces to the main connector of the OpenIMU300EZ.  The EVB and IMU module are mounted together to a precision fixture to assist in testing.  The OpenIMU300EVB uses an
FTDI 4-port Serial-to-USB converter to allow you to communicate with the OpenIMU300's serial ports from a laptop computer.  There are also
jumper connections to use to connect to the device's primary SPI port. Use the JTAG interface to directly download compiled code to the device
quickly.
