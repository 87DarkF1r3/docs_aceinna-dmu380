Python Interface
================

The OpenIMU Python driver supports communication with the hardware for data logging and 
device configuration over the main user UART interface of the OpenIMU hardware.  When
run in server mode, it allows connection of the OpenIMU with the developer's website
Aceinna Navigation Studio and its friendly GUI interface.

The Python driver attempts to automatically find a connected OpenIMU hardware by scanning available ports
at various baud rates.  Once a connection is established, this connection is recorded in a file named
*connection.json*.  On the next use of the driver, the driver will first attempt communication on this port
speeding up connection time.

The Python driver reads a JSON file by default named *openimu.json* to understand 
the messages - both primary output packets, as well as command/response type packets from the IMU. 
These can be customized by changing the JSON file and the Python script will use that information
to parse data (literally the byte stream) from the OpenIMU in real-time appropriately.  

Here are a few samples function you can call with the driver.

.. code:: python

    # Create a device and connect to it
    imu = OpenIMU()
    imu.find_device()

    # Get all parameters by issuing 'gA' command
    imu.openimu_get_all_param()

    # Update a parameter by issuing 'uP' command
    # See openimu.json for the parameter numbers
    # This example changes output packet rate to 100Hz
    imu.openimu_update_param(4,100)

    # Save parameter changes by issuing 'sC' command
    imu.openimu_save_config()

    # Log data for 1Hr
    # Data is logged into data directory with time of day string as default filename
    imu.start_log()
    time.sleep(3600)
    imu.stop_log()

    # Update units firmware
    # bin file is stored in .pioenvs directory and created after compilation
    # the file most be moved to where the Python driver can find it
    imu.openimu_upgrade_fw('myapp.bin')

You can also run the python code as a CLI interface to the unit.  The CLI is defined in commands.py.  If you have installed the python driver
with pip install, then navigate to a directory that contains a valid openimu.json for your unit, and you can type:

.. code:: python

    $openimu
    Connected ....OpenIMU300ZA - 0.0.1      SN:1808629112
    >>help
    Usage: 
    help : CLI help menu
    exit : exit CLI
    run : Operations defined by users
    save : Save the configuration into EEPROM
    connect : Find OpenIMU device
    upgrade : Upgrade firmware
    record : Record output data of OpenIMU on local machine
    stop : stop recording outputs on local machine
    server_start : start server thread and must use exit command to quit
    get : Read the current configuration and output data
    set : Write parameters to OpenIMU
    >>


.. note::

    As you develop code and customize your OpenIMU, you should also update *openimu.json* to keep it in sync with your changes.  This 
    way both the Python driver and developers website, ANS, will function properly and understand your units special
    programmed characteristics.  The openimu.json file updates the Python driver functions as well as the ANS website UI.
